things for me to do


## How this is gonna work
If you want me to do something, file an issue about it and i'll get to it asap. 

Try not to file an issue for anything that i wont be able to get done quickly,
the easier it is for me to close issues, the better this will work. Break things into
multiple smaller issues if you can, that way I get the rewarding opportunity of clicking
'close issues' more often.

## closing issues
If an issue requires the person who filed it to do something, i will close the issue until
it needs my attention again. 

Me closing an issue does *not* mean i'm ignoring you or rudely telling you to go away, i'm
just making sure that my list is entirely things that need my immediate attention.
