things for me to do


## How this is gonna work
If you want me to do something, file an issue about it and i'll get to it asap. 

Try not to file an issue for anything that i wont be able to get done quickly,
the easier it is for me to close issues, the better this will work. Break things into
multiple smaller issues if you can, that way I get the rewarding opportunity of clicking
'close issues' more often.
